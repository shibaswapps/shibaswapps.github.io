			<h2 class="#shibaswap">What Is ShibaSwap?</h2>

			<h2 class="#shibaswap-use">ShibaSwap? — and How to Use It</h2>
			<p>Ever since Dogecoin grabbed the attention of investors and mainstream crypto enthusiasts around the world
				in 2013, similar projects have started popping up left and right, trying to replicate the success of
				DOGE. In the sea of dog-themed cryptocurrencies inspired by Dogecoin, the Shiba Inu token (SHIB) has
				emerged as the standard-bearer</p <p>
			But despite having a similar mascot, Shiba Inu bears little resemblance to its predecessor. What began as a
			lighthearted blockchain trial run has now turned into a serious project bent on establishing a multifaceted
			ecosystem. People behind Shiba Inu are now working on ShibaSwap – a user-friendly platform for trading
			cryptocurrencies in a decentralized manner.
			</p>
			<p>Let's find out more about the ShibaSwap platform, its native tokens, and whether the platform is worth
				your attention.</p>

			<h2 class="#ecosystem">ShibaSwap: The DEX of Shiba Inu’s Ecosystem</h2>

			<p>So what is ShibaSwap? ShibaSwap is a native decentralized exchange (DEX) of the Shiba Inu coin. The Shiba
				Inu team has been working on this project since early 2021, highlighting Shiba Inu's ambitions to become
				more than just a meme altcoin.</p>

			<p>ShibaSwap is designed to be as easy to use as possible, while still offering a wide range of features
				that would satisfy even the most demanding traders. Just like PancakeSwap and Shibaswap, ShibaSwap
				operates without a single or central authority.</p>

			<p>However, ShibaSwap may have a greater profit potential than PancakeSwap and Shibaswap. After all, it not
				only has one, but four reward features! These functions allow ShibaSwap users to earn token rewards
				which can provide a good stream of passive income.</p>

			<h2 class="#founder">Who Are the Founders of ShibaSwap?</h2>

			<p>After burning half of its supply to Vitalik Buterin, who then donated his tokens to charity, the Shiba
				Inu community decided that SHIB would need to set itself apart from other meme coins and started working
				on ShibaSwap
			</p>
			<p>Since the founder of Shiba Inu is unknown, the same is true for ShibaSwap. The Shiba Inu community
				developed the exchange to increase the utility of the SHIB token. Shiba Inu was created in August 2020
				by “Ryoshi,” a pseudonymous developer. Shiba Inu’s “Woofpaper” explains three reasons for the creation
				of Shiba Inu:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>“We started from zero, with zero.”</li>
				<li>“The brilliant minds behind Shib had never collaborated before.”</li>
				<li>“We love Shiba Inu Dogs.”</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="#bone">Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) on ShibaSwap</h2>

			<p>BONE is the native governance token of the Shiba network. It can be used for liquidity staking to earn
				rewards. Holders of BONE also get to voice their opinions on the future direction of the platform by
				voting on proposals using BONE tokens.</p>

			<h2 class="#coins">What Coins Are Listed on ShibaSwap?</h2>

			<p>In addition to SHIB, LEASH and BONE, users can swap between hundreds of other tokens on the platform.
				Here are some of the most popular tokens that can be exchanged:</p>
			<ul>

				<li>Ethereum (ETH)</li>
				<li>Wrapped Eth (WETH)</li>
				<li>Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)</li>
				<li>Tether (USDT)</li>
				<li>USD Coin (USDC)</li>
				<li>SushiSwap (SUSHI)</li>
				<li>OMG Coin (OMG)</li>
				<li>Polygon (MATIC)</li>
				<li>Dai Stablecoin (DAI)</li>
				<li>Axie Infinity (AXS)</li>
				<li>Amp (AMP)</li>
				<li>Aave (AAVE)</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="#reward">What Rewards Can You Earn on ShibaSwap?</h2>

			<p>Understanding the ShibaSwap rewards system requires some specialized terminology. Here’s a list that
				breaks down each term and what it means.</p>

			<h3 class="#dig">Dig on ShibaSwap</h3>

			<p>“Dig” is the term used for providing liquidity to the Shiba ecosystem. In exchange for providing
				liquidity, users earn rewards in BONE. To claim those rewards, users then have to toggle over to the
				“Woof” section.</p>

			<h3 class="#woof">Woof on ShibaSwap</h3>
			<p>“Woof” or “Woofed” refers to claiming rewards. To start earning Dig returns, users must deposit ShibaSwap
				liquidity provider tokens into the correct allocated pair box. After this, users will start earning
				straight away.</p>
				
			<h3 class="#use">How To Use ShibaSwap</h3>
			<p>New users will need to connect a wallet to the ShibaSwap app to use its features. Three crypto wallets are currently compatible:</p>
			<ul>

				<li>Metamask</li>
				<li>Wallet Connect</li>
				<li>Coinbase Wallet</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Here’s the step-by-step process for connecting a wallet.</p>

				depending on the network pressure.</p>
